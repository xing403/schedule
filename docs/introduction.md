## Schedule directive
You can select part of the instructions, combine and sort, to achieve the effect you want. For example, by the combination of `date-time` and `notification` two directives, set to execute once an hour, then you get an instruction that will ring every hour.
If you are a fan of the Internet of Things (IOT) and have built-in MQTT messaging service, you only need to configure your own MQTT service to send MQTT content on a regular basis.
